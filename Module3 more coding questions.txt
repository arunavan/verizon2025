1. Login Functionality Automation 

You are asked to automate the login process for a web application using Selenium IDE. The login page has fields for username and password and a "Login" button. Describe the steps to: 

Record the script that enters credentials and clicks "Login". 

Add validation to check whether a successful login message or home page appears. 



2. Form Validation with Assertions 

A registration form requires users to fill in all fields and then submit. Automate the following scenario: 

Record the process of submitting the form with some fields blank. 

Insert assertions to verify that proper error messages are displayed for all required fields. 



3. Shopping Cart Scenario 

A user adds three items to a shopping cart and proceeds to checkout. Automate this scenario by: 

Recording all steps to add specific items to the cart. 

Navigating to the cart and verifying (using assertions) that the correct number of items have been added. 



4. Handling Pop-ups and Alerts 

You are automating a web application that displays a confirmation alert when deleting a record. Explain how you would: 

Record a script to click on “Delete” for a record. 

Handle the confirmation alert (accept/dismiss). 

Verify that the record is deleted or not based on the alert response. 



5. Testing Navigation Links 

The home page contains several navigation links in the menu bar. Automate the testing of these navigation links so that: 

Each link is clicked sequentially. 

After each click, verify the URL or page header to ensure correct navigation. 

Return to the home page after each validation. 



6. Parameterized Test Execution 

Suppose you need to run a search function with multiple search terms. Describe how you would: 

Use Selenium IDE’s data-driven testing (CSV or data variables) to execute the same search scenario for several terms in a single test suite. 

Validate that the correct search results page appears for each term.
