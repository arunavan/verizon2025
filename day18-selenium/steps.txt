1. What is Selenium Grid?

Selenium Grid lets you run Selenium tests in parallel across multiple machines, browsers, and operating systems.

Think of it as a “remote control” for browsers on different computers.

Hub → The central server where you send your tests. It knows which machine has which browser.

Node → A machine that actually runs the browser sessions (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

Why Use It?

Parallel execution → Run multiple tests at the same time.

Cross-browser testing → Test on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.

Cross-platform → Run on Windows, Mac, Linux.

Distributed testing → Use multiple computers for faster runs.
